# stellar_physics_simulation

WIP stellar physics simulation in C++ using OpenGL

## Implemented

- Stars change color based on temperature
- Simple gravity simulation

## TODO

- Planets
- Tool for spawning bodies with the right velocity vector so they actually orbit
- and don't slingshot to the other side of the universe
- Creating new astrophysical bodies at runtime
- UI for modifying properties of bodies & simulation parameters


## Might Implement

 - Other types of stellar objects (e.g., neutron stars, black holes)
 - Cooler looking visuals (more vibrant colors, skybox, etc.)
