# stellar_physics_simulation

WIP stellar physics simulation in C++ using OpenGL

## Future Plans

- Implement creating new astrophysical bodies at runtime
- Implement gravity
- Implement orbits


## Might Implement

 - Other types of stellar objects (e.g., neutron stars, black holes) that would be based on mass and radius
